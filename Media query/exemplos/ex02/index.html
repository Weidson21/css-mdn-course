            One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
            over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
            grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names
            were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
            were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all
            scientific knowledge and new discovery.
